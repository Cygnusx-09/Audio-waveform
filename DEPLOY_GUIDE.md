# How to Share Your Website

Right now, your website lives only on your computer (that's what `localhost` means). To share it, you need to put it on the public internet. This is called **Hosting**.

Here is the easiest way to do it for free, without needing to install anything else.

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest)
Netlify is a very popular service for hosting simple websites like this one.

1.  Open your browser and search for **"Netlify Drop"** (or go to `app.netlify.com/drop`).
2.  Open your File Explorer on your computer and locate your `ossciloscope` folder.
    *   It is located at `w:\Creative Code\ossciloscope`
3.  **Drag and drop** that entire folder onto the Netlify webpage area that says "Drag and drop your site folder here".
4.  Wait a few seconds. Netlify will upload your files and give you a unique link (something like `agitated-darwin-12345.netlify.app`).
5.  **Send that link to your friends!** It will work on their phones and computers.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Best for Learning)
If you want to get serious about coding, you should look into **GitHub**.

1.  Create a free account on [github.com](https://github.com).
2.  Download the "GitHub Desktop" app.
3.  Create a new "Repository" and upload your files.
4.  Go to the repository "Settings" -> "Pages" and turn it on.
5.  This gives you a professional looking link like `yourname.github.io/ossciloscope`.

## Important Note about Microphones
When you host this website online, browsers are very strict about privacy.
- You **MUST** ensure the site runs over **HTTPS** (the lock icon).
- Netlify and GitHub Pages provide HTTPS automatically, so you don't need to worry!
- If you send someone the link, they will get a popup asking "Allow microphone access?". They must click "Allow" for it to work.
